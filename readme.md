## Human Interface Device Android Attack Framework

HIDAAF is a python framework that makes it easy to generate HID attack scripts for the Android platform with corresponding phone models.
The HIDAAF output format is intended for the Bash Bunny (Provided by the great guys behind Hak5)
Due to the custom Android images released with certain phones (Like the Samsung Galaxy series) HIDAAF is heavily dependent on your contributions
to cover as many phone models as possible.!

Soon to be released!
